# Encryption-project
This is a school assigned project from my first semester at the University of Toronto. The program makes use of a stream cipher algorithm to encrypt plaintext into cyphertext and also has the ability to decrypt the cyphertext back to plaintext. The algorithm used was created by the computer scientist Bruce Schneier. However a small change to teh algorithm was made: For the card desks, I use card numbers 1 to 28, where numbers 27 and 28 are Jokers, as oposed to using cards with different suits.
